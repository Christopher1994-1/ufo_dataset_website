# UFO Dataset Website


I developed a website using python flask web framework, it is a UFO sightings website that uses a dataset of over 117,000 rows and distributes 
the data in such a way that a user can look through the latest sightings, monthly sightings, statistics on the dataset, and even search for a 
location to see the relevant data in that area.

This project showcases my ability with working with a large dataset and how I was able to distribute that data for users to consume in a creative way.
